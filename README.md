# Hackathon: Algorand GreenHouse Hack#1
Algorand GreenHouse Hackathon Submission | Soul Bound NFTs ARC

# Our Team 🦸‍♂️

**Atharva Desai**
*Pune, India*

Atharva gets stuff done. He’s the team communications hub, organizer, and enabler, translating the technical requirements into actionable items stakeholders can understand and back again. 

He has the ability to analyze vast amounts of information, identifying and connecting the dots to build a full picture, without losing sight of the individual tasks necessary to make that big vision happen.

In his time at Parsl, he’s developed a rare skill set — the ability to overcome the many obstacles faced when creating new technology, with a smile. When you see Atharva light up, it means something magical is about to happen on your screen.

**Matias Falcone**
*Buenos Aires, Argentina*

Matias is Parsl’s resident blockchain expert and is responsible for designing and developing the applications which use blockchain technology, including for this hackathon. He handles testing and troubleshooting, implementing the team’s great ideas, and politely explaining why the not-so-great ones aren’t going to happen.

This project, however, is a great one and Matias is somehow just a bit more excited than the rest of the team about it — probably because it understands the long-term implications and potential better than most. He’s utilizing his deep understanding of blockchains — derived from extensive research and years of experience — to ensure this project is a success. Really, he deserves a lot of the credit here as he’s the boots on the ground doing a lot of the technical gruntwork.

**Dr. Isaac Balbin**
*Melbourne, Australia*

As the visionary of this project, Isaac isn’t just all big dreams and no hard skills. He’s a PhD-educated electrical engineer and successful entrepreneur. He’s also a blockchain/cryptocurrency subject matter expert, who has given interviews on these subjects to help the average person understand their uses and potential. 

If it’s complicated but needs to be made comprehensible to an average Joe, Isaac is your translator. You may end up on a tangent or two but you’ll know more about the initial question’s subject than you thought possible (and probably 2 or 3 other things you didn’t even know you wanted to learn about).

**Kane Wray**
*Melbourne, Australia*

Don’t ask Kane Wray what he thinks Web3 and decentralization will do for the world unless you’ve got at least 6 hours and want to know the answer in great detail. Of course, if you do, at the end of those 6 hours, you’ll understand why Parsl is such a technological powerhouse as Kane is the one running the technical team.

He’s passionate about blockchain and crypto, leaning on his 10+ years of industry experience to nimbly guide the developers, while also mentoring them to reach their full potential. He’s the perfect person to chat with about the creative solutions and art that has been born from the rise of crypto and NFTs.  Just don’t take him up on his offer of a game of Magic the Gathering or Unstable Unicorns as you’ll probably lose.

**Ralf Kaiser**
*Edmonton, Canada*

If you want to talk about banking or finances, you want to talk to Ralf Kaiser.  With over 30 years of experience in the financial industry — ranging from investment to growth strategies to mergers and acquisitions — Ralf is always interested in and working with technology that’s about to change the banking industry.  Right now, it’s crypto and specifically the potential of Algorand. 

Ralf looks at what Parsl is doing and immediately calculates the impact of every new technology and initiative on the banking industry. As the expert in capital raising, investment management, and capital markets, he can do these calculations in his sleep…or over a beer at the pub (trust us, we’ve seen it.) If it involves any sort of currency, Ralf is your guy.

**Amna Shamim**
New York, United States

Amna is a storyteller who loves connecting with her audience. She’ll get inside their heads and deliver the information they want in a way they find enjoyable to consume, whether that’s through detailed technical documents or witty little bios. 

Her background is in writing and editing, and she has translated that ability to connect with the reader into a superpower that works across all communication formats, although she is still a little awkward on stage.

Consuming vast amounts of information and distilling it into easily-digestible formats is her passion (which she insists is completely normal).
